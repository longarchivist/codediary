So ... I have told myself that I would strive for JavaScript certification. This implies that at some point, I must start learning and practicing JavaScript.

By 1357, I was 25% of the way through the freeCodeCamp starting tutorial. I suspect it might be a bit too easy for me.

By 1427, I had finished the first module of Basic HTML and HTML5.

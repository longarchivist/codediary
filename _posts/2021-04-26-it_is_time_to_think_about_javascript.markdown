So ... I have told myself that I would strive for JavaScript certification. This implies that at some point, I must start learning and practicing JavaScript.

By 1357, I was 25% of the way through the freeCodeCamp starting tutorial. I suspect it might be a bit too easy for me.

By 1427, I had finished the first module.
Basic HTML and HTML5#

HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a webpage to the browser. HTML elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content. For example, different elements can describe text as a heading, paragraph, or list item.

In this course, you'll build a cat photo app to learn some of the most common HTML elements â€” the building blocks of any webpage.

It is amazing that the first entry in this blog appeared in April, more than two months ago, and I still do not have a major streak on FreeCodeCamp.

The blog format is not terribly convenient. But it will have to serve. If I really had to do a daily update blog, I would have to find a better format, but the fact is that I am using these daily blog updates as a way to kickstart my work process.

Currently I seem to have a two-day streak that ended. However, today is Monday. Thus it would be entirely reasonable to do something on FreeCodeCamp each day from now until Friday. The projects are a completely unknown quantity, but that makes the effort into an adventure.
